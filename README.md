# Salesforce Certifications

A repository of all my Salesforce Certifications. 

You can aslo verify the authenticity of the certifications by going to [Credential Verification](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/credentials/verification/). Just type in my name (`Adriaan Van Niekerk`) in the first box, press enter, and you will see a list of all the certifications I have acquired.

Another way to verify what certifications I have, is to navigate to my [Trailblazer Profile](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazer/adriaan) under the section `Certifications`.
